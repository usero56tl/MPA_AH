CONCLUSION

	If you've made it through the whole article (in which case great job!), the conclusion shouldn't come as a surprise to you. The truth is, there isn't a better system - both flexbox and the CSS grid are good at different things and should be used together, not as alternatives to one another.

	For those of you who skip directly to the conclusion of articles (no worries, we do it too), here is a summary of the comparison:

	    - CSS grids are great for building the bigger picture. They makes it really easy to manage the layout of the page, and can even handle more unorthodox and asymmetrical designs.
	    
	    - Flexbox is great at aligning the content inside elements. Use flex to position the smaller details of a design.
	    
	    - Use CSS grids for 2D layouts (rows AND columns).
	    
	    - Flexbox works better in one dimension only (rows OR columns).
	    
	    - There is no reason to use only CSS grids or only flexbox. Learn both and use them together.
